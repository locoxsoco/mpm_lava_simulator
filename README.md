# MPM 3D
The starter code for a 3D material point method simulation demo written in Taichi. This would be a good exercise for you to get used to **continuum simulations**.

> To implement your own version, click the "Use this template" button on this page and simply modify the `mpm_3d_starter.py` script.

## Installation
Make sure your `pip` is up-to-date:

```bash
$ pip3 install pip --upgrade
```

Assume you have a Python 3 environment, to install Taichi:

```bash
$ pip3 install -U taichi
```

To run the demo:

```bash
$ python mpm_3d_starter.py
```

## TODOs
The main simulation step `substep` function is intentionally left blank. You shall fill it in with proper code include the P2G, GridOp, and G2P steps. A 2D reference implementation is provided at `mpm99.py`.


## Extra credits are for the extras
There are plenty of room for hacking! We suggest a few of them for you to start with:
- Higher resolution simulations utilizing sparse data structures
- More sophisticated boundary handling and better scenes
- Better particle initialization with arbitrary shapes
- Faster P2G step without floating point atomic operations (integers are fine)
- Higher order time integration methods
- Implicit time integration methods
- Supporting more material models
- Reducing the numerical adhesion/friction/fracture artifacts
- etc.
